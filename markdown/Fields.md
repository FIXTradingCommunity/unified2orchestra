The floor rate (strike) is only required where the floating rate on a swap stream is floored at a certain strike level. The floor rate is assumed to be exclusive of any spread and is a per annum rate, expressed as a decimal. A floor rate of 5% would be represented as 0.05.                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                |
