### Codeset CouponDayCountCodeSet type int (1950)

The day count convention used in interest calculations for a bond or an interest bearing security. Absence of this field for a bond or an interest bearing security transaction implies a "flat" trade, i.e. no accrued interest determined at time of the transaction.

Feb 28th (or 29th in a leap year) is always considered as a 30th for a start date. As a comparison, in the regular 30/360 day count as used by most US agency and corporate bonds, a start date of Feb 28th (or 29th in a leap year) is still considered as the 28th (or 29th) day of a month of 30 days.                                                                                                                               |

Accrued interest to a value date on the last day of a month shall be the same as to the 30th calendar day of the same month, except for February.

Accrued interest to a value date on the last day of a month shall be the same as to the 30th calendar day of the same month, except for February. This means that a 31 is assumed to be a 30 and the 28 February (or 29 February for a leap year) is assumed to be a 28 (or 29). The assumed number of days in a year is computed as the actual number of days in the coupon period multiplied by the number of interest payments in the year.

Accrued interest to a value date on the last day of a month shall be the same as to the 30 calendar day of the same month, except for February. This means that a 31 is assumed to be a 30 and the 28 February (or 29 February for a leap year) is assumed to be a 28 (or 29). It is the most commonly used 30/360 method for non-US straight and convertible bonds issued before 1 January 1999. See also ISO 15022 MICO code 'A011'.                                                                                                                               |
| ThirtyETwoThreeSixty   | 21    | 1950022 | 21   | 30E2/360 (Eurobond basis model two)   | Interest is calculated based on a 30-day month and a 360-day year. Accrued interest to a value date on the last day of a month shall be the same as to the 30th calendar day of the same month, except for the last day of February whose day of the month value shall be adapted to the value of the first day of the interest period if the latter is higher and if the period is one of a regular schedule. This means that a 31 is assumed to be a 30 and the 28 February of a non-leap year is assumed to be equivalent to a 29 February when the first day of the interest period is a 29, or to a 30 February when the first day of the interest period is a 30 or a 31. The 29 February of a leap year is assumed to be equivalent to a 30 February when the first day of the interest period is a 30 or a 31. Similarly, if the coupon period starts on the last day of February, it is assumed to produce only one day of interest in February as if it was starting on a 30 February when the end of the period is a 30 or a 31, or two days of interest in February when the end of the period is a 29, or three days of interest in February when it is the 28 February of a non-leap year and the end of the period is before the 29.

| ThirtyEThreeThreeSixty | 22    | 1950023 | 22   | 30E3/360 (Eurobond basis model three) | Interest is calculated based on a 30-day month and a 360-day year. Accrued interest to a value date on the last day of a month shall be the same as to the 30th calendar day of the same month. This means that a 31 is assumed to be a 30 and the 28 February (or 29 February for a leap year) is assumed to be equivalent to a 30 February. It is a variation of the 30E/360 (or Eurobond basis) method where the last day of February is always assumed to be a 30, even if it is the last day of the maturity coupon period.
