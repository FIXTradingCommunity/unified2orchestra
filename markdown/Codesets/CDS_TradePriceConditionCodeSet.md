To be used only if it is not clear whether it is a special cum or special ex dividend. For ESMA RTS 1, this is the "SDIV" flag.                                                                                                                               |
| PriceImprovement                   | 14    | 1839015 | 14   | Price improvement                      | The price is better than a reference price. For example, this may be due to an offer by a systematic internaliser to always quote better prices than a public reference price. For ESMA RTS 1, this is the "RPRI" flag.                                                                                                                               |
| NonPriceFormingTrade               | 15    | 1839016 | 15   | Non-price forming trade                | In the context of MiFID II, these are transactions which are exempted from the trading obligation (i.e. permitted to be transacted as an OTC transaction) and are deemed not to be contributing to the price discovery process. However, these transactions are not exempted from post trade transparency reporting and are required to be published by MiFID venues and "approved publication arrangement" (APAs) for market transparency purposes. The price from exempted transactions should be disregarded for the purposes of price discovery. For ESMA RTS 1 and RTS 2, this is the "NPFT" flag. |
| TradeExemptedFromTradingObligation | 16    | 1839017 | 16   | Trade exempted from trading obligation | Per MiFIR Article 23, these types of trades are not exempted from post-trade transparency if reported to a trading venue under MiFID II and deemed "on exchange", however, they are ignored for price formation despite published by venue. For ESMA RTS 1, this is the "TNCP" flag.                                                                                                                               |
| PricePending                       | 17    | 1839018 | 17   | Price or strike price is pending       | In the context of ESMA RTS 2, Annex II, Table 1 "Price", and RTS 22 Table 2 fields 33 "Price" and 51 "Strike price", this is ESMA's "PNDG" value. Used to indicate the transaction is pending a price or strike price at the time it was reported.                                                                                                                               |
| PriceNotApplicable                 | 18    | 1839019 | 18   | Price is not applicable                | In the context of ESMA RTS 2, Annex II, Table 1, Price and RTS 22, Annex I, Table 2, Field 33, this is to flag that the price is "not applicable" for the transaction at the time it was reported. This is ESMA's "NOAP" value in RTS 22.                                                                                                                               |
