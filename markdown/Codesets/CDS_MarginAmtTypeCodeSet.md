| AdditionalMargin         | 1     | 1644001 | 1    | Additional Margin                 | Component of the total margin calculation which allows the CCP to include amounts generated outside of the Margin Deficit. Additional risk charges collected when a firm is placed on higher than normal surveillance./P/Additional margin serves to cover the additional liquidation costs that potentially could be incurred. Such possible close-out costs could arise if, based on the current market value of a portfolio, the worst case loss were to occur within a 24-hour period. It is used for options (also options on futures) and non-spread futures positions, bonds and equity trades. For bonds and equity trades, the additional margin is calculated for security positions but not for the corresponding cash positions. |

The purpose of Futures Spread Margin is to cover this risk until the next trading day./P/This kind of margin is levied in order to cover those risks associated with a futures spread which could arise between today and tomorrow.                                                                                                                               |
