| ClientNaturalWorking   | H     | 104008 | 8    | Client natural working                          | With reference to the AFME/IA Framework for Indications of Interest, this is to be used to denote IOIs of type C2 – Client Natural (Working). A client should be able to seek verification (from IOI publisher’s management/compliance) that, for any C2 IOIs received, there was a corresponding live client order for at least the advertised size prior to the IOI being generated. Resulting trades are expected to be of a riskless nature.                                                                                                                               |

Post-execution, a client should be able to seek verification (from IOI publisher’s management/ compliance) that, for any P1 IOIs received and executed against, there was by time of the execution, an opposing specific client order. Resulting trades are expected to be of a riskless nature. If the anticipated client order does not materialise, and the broker elects to commit capital, this must be disclosed prior to execution.                      |

Brokers will be likely be sourcing liquidity and therefore may advertise the size of IOI they wish; however, clients can expect the broker to honour the size of IOI shown. The presumption is that there is no intent to immediately unwind the position without notification, however, brokers may provide additional granularity to the category and may offer bilateral post trade commitments. Brokers will also offer clients a feedback mechanism. |
