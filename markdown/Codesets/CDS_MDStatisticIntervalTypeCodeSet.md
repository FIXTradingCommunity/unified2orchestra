| SlidingWindowPeak                | 2     | 2464002 | 2    | Sliding window peak                    | Highest value of all sliding windows across date and/or time range. Omission of date/time range represents current day.                                                                                                                               |
| FixedDateRange                   | 3     | 2464003 | 3    | Fixed date range                       | Interval may be open ended on either side, see MDStatisticStartDate (2468) and MDStatisticEndDate(2469). Starting/ending time of date fields only apply to the first/last day of the date range. Additional time range may be defined with MDStatisticStartTime(2470) and MDStatisticEndTime(2471) and applies to every business day within date range, i.e. to define an identical time slice across days. |
| FixedTimeRange                   | 4     | 2464004 | 4    | Fixed time range                       | Interval may be open ended on either side, see MDStatisticStartTime(2470) and MDStatisticEndTime(2471).                                                                                                                               |

Interval ends with the time of dissemination of the statistic. Requires the definition of an actual unit, see MDStatisticIntervalTypeUnit(2465).                                                                                                                               |

Requires the definition of an actual unit, see MDStatisticIntervalTypeUnit(2465).                                                                                                                               |

| MaximumRangeUpToPreviousTimeUnit | 8     | 2464008 | 8    | Maximum range up to previous time unit | Use to convey record values over the lifetime of the system or venue but does not include the most recent time unit as it has not completed yet. Requires the definition of an actual unit, see MDStatisticIntervalTypeUnit(2465)                                                                                                                               |
