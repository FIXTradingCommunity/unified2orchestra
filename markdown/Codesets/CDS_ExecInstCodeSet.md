Facilitation services are when an institutional client allows a broker to assume a risk-taking principal position rather than an agency position, to obtain liquidity or achieve a guaranteed execution price on the client's behalf. Interpretation of absence of this value needs to be bilaterally agreed, if applicable. In the context of Hong Kong's SFC, this can be used to comply with SFC regulations for disclosure of client facilitation. |
