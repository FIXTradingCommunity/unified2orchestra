### Codeset ComplexEventConditionCodeSet type int (1490)

Specifies the condition between complex events when more than one event is specified.
Multiple barrier events would use an "or" condition since only one can be effective at a given time. A set of digital range events would use an "and" condition since both conditions must be in effect for a payout to result.
