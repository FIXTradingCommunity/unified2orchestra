### Group AllocGrp category Allocation (2003)

This repeating group is optionally used for messages with AllocStatus(87) = 2 (account level reject), AllocStatus(87) = 0 (accepted), to provide details of the individual accounts that were accepted or rejected. In the case of a reject, the reasons for the rejection should be specified. This group should not be populated where AllocStatus(87) has any other value.
