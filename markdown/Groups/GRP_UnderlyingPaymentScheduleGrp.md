### Group UnderlyingPaymentScheduleGrp category Common (4067)

The UnderlyingPaymentScheduleGrp is a repeating subcomponent of the UnderlyingPaymentStream component used to specify notional and rate steps in the payment stream.

#### Elaboration

The Fixing Lag Interval (UnderlyingPaymentScheduleFixingLagPeriod(41893) and UnderlyingPaymentScheduleFixingLagUnit(41894)) and the First Observation Offset Duration (UnderlyingPaymentScheduleFixingFirstObservationOffsetPeriod(41895) and UnderlyingPaymentScheduleFixingFirstObservationOffsetUnit(41896)) are used together. If the First Observation Offset Duration is specified, the observation starts the Fixing Lag Interval prior to each calculation. If the First Observation Offset Duration is not specified, the observation starts immediately preceeding each calculation.
