### Group PayCollectGrp category AccountReporting (2192)

The Pay Collect Group component block is a repeatable block intended to report individual pay/collect items to be considered when calculating net settlement.

#### Elaboration

A Pay/Collect is a payment or collection of funds by the clearing house to/from a clearing firm for a specific reason. Pay/Collects are typically netted to a single amount and factored into the firmâ€™s daily net settlement. Values are to be maintained by an external code list. The currency of the pay/collect amount may be optionally included.
