### Group PaymentScheduleGrp category Common (4077)

The PaymentScheduleGrp is a repeating subcomponent of the StreamGrp component used to specify notional and rate steps of the payment stream.

#### Elaboration

The Fixing Lag Interval (PaymentScheduleFixingLagPeriod(41176) and PaymentScheduleFixingLagUnit(41177)) and the First Observation Offset Duration (PaymentScheduleFixingFirstObservationOffsetPeriod(41178) and PaymentScheduleFixingFirstObservationOffsetUnit(41179)) are used together. If the First Observation Offset Duration is specified, the observation starts the Fixing Lag Interval prior to each calculation. If the First Observation Offset Duration is not specified, the observation starts immediately preceeding each calculation.
