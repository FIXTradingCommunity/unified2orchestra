### Group PaymentGrp category Common (4027)

The PaymentGrp is a repeating component used to report additional payments or bullet payments.

#### Elaboration

This component is positioned outside the Instrument component as it is used to specify payments based on the price and terms of the contract, e.g. upfront fee, premium amount, security lending fee and contract-based rebates.
When PaymentFrequencyUnit(43103) and PaymentFrequencyPeriod(43102) are specified the payments are deemed to be periodic for the specified PaymentType(40213).
